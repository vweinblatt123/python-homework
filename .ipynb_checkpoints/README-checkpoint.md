Note: For PyRamen, I present two solutions. The first uses the provided HW starter (main.ipynb). However, it appears that this design requires looping over all the menu items for each sales item. As such, this will run in O(n^2) time and appears not be a terribly efficient solution. Therefore, I produced a second solution (main_v2.ipynb) that runs in O(n) time by first looping through the menu items and creating a dictionary that can be accessed in linear time when, next, looping through the sales items. This version loops through the two datasets just once and is a more efficient solution.
